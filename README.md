# MLB-HOSS
Aiming to define a new MLB statistic, **HOSS**.

In this project, a "**Hoss**" will be defined as a big-bodied, physically imposing power pitcher. A **Hoss** not only dominates with pitch velocity and movement, but with his **_overweight aura_**.

## Examples
Some pitchers I would expect to have a high HOSS statistic:
- Roger Clemens
- CC Sabathia
- Randy Johnson
- Tarik Skubal
- Paul Skenes

## Counter-Examples
The opposite of a **Hoss** is a *pipsqueak*. A *pipsqueak* dances around the edge of the zone with an 89-91 mph fastball and throws various above-average breaking balls. A *pipsqueak* may be an effective pitcher, but has nowhere near the aura of a **Hoss**.

# Results

The following are seasons classified as **Hoss** Seasons, ranked by the **HOSS** statistic.

*Note: FanGraphs does not contain pitching data pre-2002, so this only contains HOSS seasons from 2002 to 2025 as of 16-AUG-2025.*
